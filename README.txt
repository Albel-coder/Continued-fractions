# Fraction and Continued Fraction Converter

Description:

This C++ console application allows you to convert ordinary fractions of the form a / b into continued fractions (expansion into a continued fraction) and back - restore an ordinary fraction from a continued one.

## Features: 
- Decomposition of a fraction into a continued fraction: 
Input: a / b (e.g. 45 / 16) → Output: [2; 1, 4, 3] (decomposition). 
- Restoration of a fraction from a continued fraction: 
Input: [2; 1, 4, 3] → Output: 45 / 16. 
- Input validation and error handling. 
- Support for negative fractions.
